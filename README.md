# 📦 COVID-19 Trade Impact Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on global trade using interactive data visualizations, forecasting, clustering, and recovery insights. Built with Jupyter Notebook, it leverages pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ipywidgets, and scikit-learn for a comprehensive and interactive portfolio-ready dashboard.

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 **Summary Insights**: Fastest-recovering countries, most affected transport modes, top trade drops, and bounce-back speed.
- 📈 **ARIMA Forecasting**: 12-month forecast of trade values per country and measure.
- 🌍 **Country Comparisons**: Line plots, normalized recovery trends, and transport mode contributions.
- 🧩 **Clustering Analysis**: Groups countries based on their trade recovery patterns using k-means.
- 🕹️ **Interactive Widgets**: Toggle between `$` and `Tonnes`, select countries, date ranges, thresholds, and clustering parameters.
